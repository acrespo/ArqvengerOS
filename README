I'm in space!

Besides that, there's something you need to take into account before trying to build the project:
1. Create a bin/ and img/ folders
2. Obtain a copy of tpe.img file and drop it in img/
3. Create a flat disk image with bximage, and format it with mkfs.ext2 -r 0
4. Setup your .mtoolsrc and .bochsrc
5. Create and populate src/common.mk
    In most 32-bit linux systems the content will simply be:
    CC=gcc
    LD=ld

    If you're not in one of those, well my friend, you're in for a treat. You need a cross compiler for i386-aout-linux and then you set your common.mk to:
    CC=path to your cross gcc
    LD=path to your cross ld
6. Go to src and build it!
    Here you have a choice, you can use the round robin scheduler, and a priority based scheduler.
    To build with the round robin scheduler just do: make SCHEDULER=scheduler
    To build with the priority based scheduler: make SCHEDULER=priorityScheduler
7. Enjoy
