I'm in space!

Besides that, there's something you need to take into account before trying to build the project:
1. Create a bin/ and img/ folders
2. Obtain a copy of tpe.img file and drop it in img/
3. Setup your .mtoolsrc and .bochsrc
4. Create and populate src/common.mk
    In most 32-bit linux systems the content will simply be:
    CC=gcc
    LD=ld

    If you're not in one of those, well my friend, you're in for a treat. You need a cross compiler for i386-aout-linux and then you set your common.mk to:
    CC=path to your cross gcc
    LD=path to your cross ld
