Important stuff
 - Remap the PIC
 - Handle processor exceptions, and by handle, I mean crash & burn
 - Figure out how to work with read and things like scanf (Maybe make scanf a syscall?)
 - How does read work in linux? Does it read scan codes? Is it line buffered? How in god's green earth does this work?
 - Set up basic libc stuff
 - Handle ctrl alt supr in the keyboard int
 - Handle modifier keys

Wishlist:
 - Screen scroll
 - Colores en la tty! Usando algun marker ascii non-printable non-null podemos marcar que el proximo byte setea el color a usar.
